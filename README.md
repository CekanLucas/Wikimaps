## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database.
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.

## Dependencies

- Node 10.x or above
- NPM 5.x or above
- PG 6.x

- Build a web app from start to finish using the tech and approaches learned to date
- Turn requirements into a working product
- Practice architecting an app in terms of UI/UX, Routes/API and Database
- Manage a multi-developer project with git
- Simulate the working world where you do not always get to completely cherry pick your team, stack or product features
- Practice demoing an app to help prepare for the final project and employer interviews
